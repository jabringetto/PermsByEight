PERMS BY EIGHT:

An OSX command line application that, when provided a valid numeric input, returns whether or not any permutations of the entered number are divisible by eight. For example, if the user were to input '211', the program would find the permutation '112' (112 = 8 * 14) and state that yes, '211' has permutations which are divisible by eight.
